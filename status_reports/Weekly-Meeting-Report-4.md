### Discussion Notes

### Goals

* Research and develop better understanding of project parameters. 
* Get in touch with our contact at Alliant Energy to clarify some design specifications.
* Research categories will be divided amongst team members and discussd further at next group meeting.

### Achievements

1. Designed and implemented fake HTTP/HTTPS login honeypot
2. Designed and implemented fake SSH server honeypot
3. Drafted initial firewall and network architecture specifications.
4. Researched build and deployment automation tools
   * Initial prototype will use Ansible and (possibly) Docker

### Pending Issues

* Discuss Integration into SCADA environment
* Identify further EE implementation and possible contributions.
* Client still needs to provide the following information at a future date:	
   * What protocol(s) is the honeypot using to communicate?
   * Identify what equipment configuration honeypot might be emulating.
   * Identify hardware requirements based on customers needs.
