\section*{\color{NavyBlue}Introduction}
%SCADA (Supervisory Control and Dada Acquisition) Systems play a vital role in
%the infrastructure of modern day society. They provide a convenient way to
%control and a multitude of systems/data that make everyday life possible. These
%systems include water treatment facilities, oil pipelines, electrical power
%transmission stations and HVAC systems. Many of these systems however are run
%on older technology that have been customized to meet the specific needs of the
%facility or company they reside in. Because of this, SCADA systems are often
%prone to attack due to the impact disrupting even one could bring to a company 
%or region of a country. Due to this threat Alliant Energy has reached out to
%ISU to provide a way of monitoring 28 of their power substations via a
%low-interaction SCADA honeypot system.

\subsection*{Background}

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a vital role in
maintaining and controlling critical infrastructure such as
water treatment plants, oil pipelines, HVAC Systems, and the power grid.
The societal importance of these services makes them a high-value target
for well-funded, highly-skilled adversaries who increasingly turn to digital
and electronic attack vectors, exploiting old and outdated protocols that
were never designed to be exposed to the public internet.
Thus, rapid intrusion detection and response is crucial for safeguarding
SCADA networks.

A \textit{honeypot} (a system designed to mimic a legitimate protocol, e.g.
SSH, coerce an attacker into interacting with it, and then report attacker
activity  to an administrator) is an old and well-understood approach to
detecting network intruders. Our client, Alliant Energy, requested many
small honeypot systems, each capable of speaking multiple protocols, to place
inside their electrical substations.

\subsection*{Problem}

- Designed to run on a single box.
- not written in memory safe/type safe languages
- Most don't speak many protocols.
- Can't run on embedded/small/cheap system.
- Need to coordinate central logs.
- Roll out all at the same time.
- most can't do scada.
- not pluggable/maintainable.
- etc. just put some shit that really motivates our project.
