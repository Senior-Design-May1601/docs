\section*{The Problem}
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Dada Acquisition) Systems play a vital role in
the infrastructure of modern day society. They provide a convenient way to
control and a multitude of systems/data that make everyday life possible. These
systems include water treatment facilities, oil pipelines, electrical power
transmission stations and HVAC systems. Many of these systems however are run
on older technology that have been customized to meet the specific needs of the
facility or company they reside in. Because of this, SCADA systems are often
prone to attack due to the impact disrupting even one could bring to a company 
or region of a country. Due to this threat Alliant Energy has reached out to
ISU to provide a way of monitoring 28 of their power substations via a
low-interaction SCADA honeypot system.
