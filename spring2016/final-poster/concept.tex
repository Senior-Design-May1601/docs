Each device has two network interfaces: one in promiscuous mode forwarding
local network traffic to an internal IDS, and another forwarding incoming
traffic to the honeypot plugin system. Local device firewalls, administrator
keys, package dependencies, and other site-specific artifacts are setup
globally through the Ansible configuration management system.
