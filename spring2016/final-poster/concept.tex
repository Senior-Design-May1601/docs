In Figure \ref{fig:concept} above, the public interface is created from two components.  A framework for providing imitations of various TCP/IP services and a SSH server for administrative access. The honeypot framework acts as a process manager starting services that will appear publicly available to the network. When there is an attempt to connect to one of these services, an event notification will be created and sent to Alliant Energy through the Splunk data platform. An instance of Snort IDS is provided in conjunction. It is an open source intrusion detection system used to monitor network traffic and will also notify Alliant Energy of any network intrusions through Splunk. Both the public interface and Snort operate behind a Linux based firewall called IP-Tables which has defined rule sets to secure ports.

Provisioning of each component is done through Ansible which is an IT automation platform. It provides a method for Alliant energy to implement custom configurations and specify new services for the public interface. It also allows Alliant Energy to install the software on many devices quickly because Ansbile will install all dependencies and start all services automatically.
