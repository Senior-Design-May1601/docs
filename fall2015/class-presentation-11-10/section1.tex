\begin{block}{The Problem}
SCADA networks around the country face the threat of intrusions everyday. Keeping these networks secure and safe is of utmost importance.
\end{block}

Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are highly automated industrial control systems which are utilized in:
\begin{itemize} % Elaborate on each item
\item Power plants
\item Water treatment facilities
\item Civil defense systems
\item Commercial transportation systems
\end{itemize}
    Because of the importance of these networks it is crucial that they be kept secure from any and all attacks.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Why the threat? } \begin{itemize}\item SCADA networks are often located in facilities which may be hard to reach
\item High life expectancy.
\item Down-Time limitations = difficult to update.
\end{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Goal: }To create a small standalone device for 28 of Alliant Energy's Supervisory Control  And Data Acquisition networks.
\item \textbf{Criteria For Success: }A small standalone device capable of replicating false  SCADA protocols to fool potential attacker.  The device should also be able to log  attack parameters and alert administrative personnel for action.
\end{itemize}
