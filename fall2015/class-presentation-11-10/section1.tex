\begin{itemize} % Elaborate on each item
\item The Problem:  Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are    highly automated industrial control systems such as power plants, water treatment  facilities and transportation systems.  Because of the importance of these networks  it is crucial to keeping them secure from any attacks.
\item Goal: To create a standalone device for 28 of Alliant Energy's Supervisory Control  And Data Acquisition networks.
\item Criteria For Success:  A small standalone device capable of replicating false  SCADA protocols to fool potential attacker.  The device should also be able to log  attack parameters and alert administrative personnel for action.
