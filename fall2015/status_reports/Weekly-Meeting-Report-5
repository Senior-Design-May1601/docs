### Discussion Notes

### Goals

* Consult EE professors to identify possible extra EE implementations.
* consolidate files of pre-liminary Virtual Machine Prototype and run initial simulation.

### Achievements

1. identified possible EE implementations to be run by client at next meeting.

### Pending Issues

* Verify hardware is adequate to run initial prototype Honeypot.
* Identify constraints of minnimal IDS on present hardware.
* Client may provide the following information at a future date.
  * Possible SCADA environment details
