\chapter{Conclusion}

With the culmination of the concepts outlined in the above document, the design team of May1601 believes that specifications outlined and agreed upon between we the team and the client will be satisfied. With the inclusion of a public interface, SSH and WEB servers, minimal IDS support, and event logging we believe that our product will perform as advertised while maintaining a minimized footprint in both cost and power consumption. By keeping our product smaller and simple we believe our honeypot will prove a viable and cost efficient alternative to commonly used open source honeypots. With a planned prototype implementation by the end of the Fall 2015 semester, there will be ample time in the Spring to modify the current design of the product or implement further functionality which the client may desire.
