\chapter{Interface and System Description}

\section{Design Specification}

The system will be composed of layered services, with communication done
through a standardized interface (see Figure \ref{figure:device} for a
simplified diagram).
%TODO: Elaborate more on the different services and give a brief description of what to expect from the upcoming section they are about to read.
\subsection{Layer 1: The External Interface}

The outermost layer of the device is external interface and the only point at
which \textit{incoming} network traffic is accepted. Access is controlled
by a set up an IPTables\footnote{\url{http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables}}
ruleset.

\subsubsection{The Public Interface}

The public interface, visible to anyone on the device's network, is the
interface through which attackers interact with the various honeypots. Since
honeypot services are designed to run unprivileged and without any additional
capabilities, the services themselves run on high, non-standard
ports (for instance, 8022 for SSH and 8080 for HTTP).

Firewall rules forward traffic from the open standard port (e.g. 22 for SSH)
to the high, non-standard port on localhost where the actual honeypot
is listening.
%TODO:Are we using 8022 for SSH or 2222?  I saw in your fssh.go file you used a default port of 2222.
%TODO:When explaining the that the firewall forwards the standard ports to non-standard ports possibly explain the security benefits of doing so.
%TODO:Possibly mention that the public interface will have two means of ingress through two separate NICs?  Just bring up the concept of the promiscuous interface.
\subsubsection{The Administration Interface}

Devices must be updated and configurable, so there needs to be a way for
administrators to log in and perform routine maintenance. However, the device
also should not expose a public SSH service with real login capabilities, and
the honeypot SSH service can't be used for real system tasks.

Therefore, the device will use Single Packet Authorization
\footnote{\url{http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-madhat.pdf}}
to disguise the administration interface, only opening the port for a single
connection to a particular IP address when presented with valid cryptographic
credentials.
%TODO:Explain what program we will use to accomplish the task of Single Packet Authorization?
%TODO:Should this section talk about Ansible and its remote administration capabilities?
\subsubsection{The Promiscuous Interface}

The device will run an IDS in order to pick up anomolies and attacks on
the greater internal network. The IDS will watch both incoming traffic to
the device as well as sniff traffic on the internal network through a
promiscuous interface.

\subsection{Layer 2: Low-Interaction Honeypot Microservices}

The honeypots themselves will be implemented as isolated and unprivileged
microservices. They will not have full program capabilities and will only
allow enough interaction to determine:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If a passive attacker is accessing the device
    \item If an active attacker is accessing the device
    \item What, if any, credentials an active attacker attempts to use
    \item Metadata about the attacker (IP address, MAC address, date/time, etc.)
\end{itemize}

For example, the SSH honeypot is \textit{not} a real SSH server. It is simply
a small program that steps through the SSH authentication handshake and
\textit{always} returns an ``authentication failed'' protocol message. This
way, enough information is collected to analyze the attack, but it is not
possible for the attacker to actually login or exploit the underlying
SSH service.

Each honeypot will push alerts to a logging module, which
can send them on to a configured Splunk endpoint.

- Build automation (Ansible, Docker)
- Layers of micro-services
- Report back to a centralized logger
- Logger pushes alerts to Splunk
- IDS (Bro) running on device, interface in promiscuous mode
    - pick up high port traffic
- SPA on high, non-standard SSH port for administration purposes
- External ports forwarded to localhost high ports so no micro services
  run as root
- "Low interaction", so not possible to actually log in. We'll just catch
  any uname/passwd/key pairs.
- Actual SCADA service emulation
%TODO:Might not be using Bro IDS use generic IDS
%TODO:Define what SPA is either here or when you first mentioned it in the "Administrative Interface" section.
%TODO:Try to avoid using words such as “we’ll” since it makes the document feel less formal.
\subsection{Layer 3: The Logger}

The logger is a module that receives alerts from the honeypot microservices
and the IDS. The logger has access to the Splunk authentication credentials
and server details.

If the Splunk server is reachable, the logger pushes device alerts to it,
possibly after augmenting the alerts with additional metadata. If the Splunk
server is not reachable, the logger caches alerts until Splunk comes back
online, at which point all cached alerts are pushed.

\section{Technical Approach}

Our design and implementation strategy is guided by a handful of core
technical principles.
%TODO:Expand upon this sentence to make it seem more like an intro to a section and not just brief description.
\subsubsection{Automation}

Since our goal is to deploy \textit{multiple} devices at many different
locations, we aim to automate as much of the build and configuration process
as possible. Therefore, we will use Ansible
\footnote{\url{http://www.ansible.com/}} for easy remote setup for
multiple devices. We will also use Docker
\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/}} to configure the individual
honeypot microservices. This setup will allow for very simple device rollouts
and updates.
%TODO:Avoid using the word very.
\subsubsection{Safe Languages}

As much as possible, we will only deploy services written in a ``safe''
language. To support this goal, the initial prototypes of the HTTP, HTTPS,
and SSH microservice honeypots have been written in Golang
\footnote{\url{https://golang.org/}}.

\subsubsection{Honeypots Don't Get Real Capabilities}

Unlike medium- and high-interaction honeypots such as Kippo
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/desaster/kippo}}, our honeypot microservices
will not provide any real system capabilities. Since the device will be
running in an internal, protected environment, \textit{any} traffic should
be considered an attack, and by only mimicking protocol initiation handshakes
without providing actual program capabilities, we gain some protection
against unknown exploits.

\subsubsection{Heavily Restrict Traffic}

The device will heavily restrict \textit{all} traffic, including outbound
traffic, to a set of known and trusted servers. This will help mitigate any
damage a compromised microservice on the device could cause.

\subsubsection{Disguise Administration Interface}

Since we aim to both trick an attacker into believing the services running
on the device are legitimate, as well as restrict access to \textit{actual}
services on the device, the administration interface will only be
accessible using Single Packet Authorization.
%TODO:Possibly elaborate more on the administration interface.
\section{Design and Implementation Stages}

Design and implementation is broken up into three logical and somewhat
self-contained stages. Each stage encompasses a design component, an
implementation component, and an evaluation and testing component. Each stage
implements a particular subset of the desired functionality.

\subsection{Stage 1}

Design and Implementation Stage 1 will consist of a number of initial tasks,
design iterations, and prototyping. By completion of stage 1, the device
should be running a few small honeypot microservices for common protocols,
running a very minimal IDS rulset, and have a minimal build automation
procedure.

\subsubsection{Minimal Build Automation}

The device will be able to install all required dependencies automatically
as part of the deployment procedure.

\subsubsection{HTTP/HTTPS Honeypot}

The device will be running an HTTP/HTTPS honeypot with a fake login page.

\subsubsection{SSH Honeypot}

The device will be running an SSH honeypot.

\subsubsection{Pushing to Splunk}

Both the HTTP/HTTPS honeypot and the SSH honeypot should be able to push
alerts to an external Splunk server.

\subsubsection{Open High Ports}

At the client's request, the device will have 3 open high ports listening
for incoming traffic.

\subsubsection{Minimal IDS}

Bro IDS will be used to push alerts to Splunk if any incoming traffic is seen
on the 3 high ports.

\subsubsection{Unit Testing and Bug Fixes}

Each component of Stage 1 will have full unit tests (where applicable).


\subsection{Stage 2}

Design and Implementation Stage 2 will extend the work done in Stage 1,
standardize module communication, and provide the first real SCADA protocol
emulation.

\subsubsection{Better Deployment Automation}

In Stage 2, general system hardening, custom firewall setup, and Bro
configuration will be automated as part of the deployment step.

\subsubsection{Standardized Logging Module}

A standardized logging module will be implemented, through which all honeypot
microservices can push logs to Splunk.

\subsubsection{Promiscuous Network Interface}

A second network interface will be added to listen in promiscuous mode, used
by Bro IDS to pick up alerts from the greater internal network.

\subsubsection{Custom IDS Configuration}

Bro will be configured to alert on domain-specific and network-specific
indicators, such as known energy-sector malware and internal ping sweeps.

\subsubsection{OPC Honeypot}

A microservice will be implemented to emulate the OPC protocol, the first
SCADA protocol used on the device.

\subsubsection{Unit Testing and Bug Fixes}

Each component of Stage 2 will have full unit tests (where applicable).


\subsection{Stage 3}

Design and Implementation Stage 3 will finalize module communication and
build automation, provide a full integration testing suite, and allow time
to tweak the design to fit the client's particular needs, including adding
additional SCADA protocols and customizing the build process to the client's
needs.

\subsubsection{Finalize Build and Deployment Automation}

Build and deployment automation procedures and configuration needs will be
finalized with the client.

\subsubsection{Single Packet Authorization}

Stage 3 will integrate a small Single Packet Authorization module into the
device for remote administration.

\subsubsection{Custom SCADA Protocols}

By working closely with the client, any additional SCADA protocols needed will
be implemented using the microservice pattern established in design stages 1
and 2.

\subsubsection{Unit Testing and Bug Fixes}

Each component of Stage 3 will have full unit tests (where applicable).

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}

A full integration test suite will be written to test data flow through the
system and, when possible, work to verify system correctness.

\section{Functional Testing Plan}

Each primary device componenet will have both unit tests, when applicable,
as well as integration tests to determine, as well as possible, if the
component is functioning as specified. The device testing plan is specified
in Table \ref{table:test-plan}. Note that all microservice testing procedures
will follow the same strategy, so they have been collapsed to one table
entry.
%TODO: First sentence worded oddly, consider using sentence fragments.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l  c  c}
Component & Unit Tests & Integration Tests \\
\hline
Build Automation & \xmark & Test deployment on virtual machines \\
Bro IDS & \xmark & Perform attacks and verify alerting \\
Microservices & \cmark & Attempt to login to active service \\
Logger & \cmark & Verify logging correct on Splunk instance \\
Single Packet Authorization & \cmark & Verify login succeeds/fails \\
Promiscuous Interface & \xmark & Verify Bro receives traffic \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Functional Testing Plan}
\label{table:test-plan}
\end{table}

%TODO: Be sure to change all the instances  where you talk about the Bro IDS specifically toa more generic form since we are not sure if we will be using it or not.
